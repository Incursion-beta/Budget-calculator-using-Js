# Budget-calculator


A budget calculator to measure monthly expenses and incomes.

A simple application calculating monthly expenses. Currently it's not saving it's state in local storage (which means, if you refresh it's gone), but can be used as a calculator if you have invoices for instance after a month and you want to see the places your money has goneüçøüçª.

You can try it out [here](https://javpet.github.io/Budget-calculator/).
